    "First things first, we need to make sure you understand how this camp will work. We'll be using JupyterLab in order to play around with Python 3. There's several different ways to do this, including onein which you don't need to install anything, just use JupyterLite running Pyodide from your Chrome browser. But the main way I'll illustrate here is to install Python 3 to your computer, then use the command line to install Jupiter Notebooks.\n",

If not, navigate to your operating system, then the latest version of Python (Python 3 recommended) listed. When at all possible, download the \"installer\" so you don't have to build it yourself (that activity is outside the scope of this class).\n",
