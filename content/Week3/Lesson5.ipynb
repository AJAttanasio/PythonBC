    "In programming, as you start to write longer and more complex programs, one thing you'll start to notice is how often the same set of steps need to be repeated in many different places within a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **function** is a key element in writing such programs. You can think of a function in a computing language in much the same way you think of a mathematical function. The function takes in arguments, performs some operation based on the identities of the arguments, and then returns a result. For example, the mathematical function *f(x,y)=xy* takes arguments *x* and *y* and then returns the product of those two arguements, *xy*. In this lesson, we will learn how to construct functions in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Some tasks need to be performed multiple times within a program. Rather than rewrite the same code in multiple places, a function may be defined using the `def` keyword. Function definitions may include **parameters**, providing data input to the function.\n",

    "> Functions may return a value using the `return` keyword followed by the value to return.\n",

Parameters are variables that are defined in the function definition. They are assigned the values which were passed as arguments when the function was called, elsewhere in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Multiple Parameters:** Python functions can have multiple parameters. Just as you wouldn’t go to school without both a backpack and a pencil case, functions may also need more than one input to carry out their operations. To define a function with multiple parameters, parameter names are placed one after another, separated by commas, within the parentheses of the function definition.\n",

    "## Built-in functions in Python\n",
    "The Python programming language has several built-in functions. We've already discussed `print()`, `id()`, `ord()`, `len()`, `range()`, `enumerate()`, `zip()`, and `reversed()`, in addition to type conversions such as `list()`. The complete set of built-in functions can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html). A word of warning about these functions and naming your own: ***Never define a function or variable with the same name as a built-in function.***\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Python has keywords (such as `def`, `for`, `in`, `if`, `True`, `None`, etc.), many of which have already been encountered. A complete list of them is [here](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords). The interpreter will throw an error if you try to define a function or variable with the same name as a keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Final Note\n",
    "Let’s pause for a moment and think about what functions do. Not just in the abstract sense of \"oh, what is a function and what is its place within my program\", but also in the specific sense of \"what do I want *this particular* function to do?\" And, more to the point: how do we expect a certain function to act?\n",
    "Every time you sit down to write a function (or really any program in general, it's just good practice), ask yourself these questions:\n",
    "- What is this code supposed to do?\n",
    "- And how can I make sure it's doing that?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to that second question is to write a test. A *function test* is a set of parameter(s) that we call a function with such that the returned value(s) is known. For example, taking our previous `product()` function and using the age-old rule \"anything multiplied by 0 is 0\", we can write the test:"
