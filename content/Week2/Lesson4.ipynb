    "In our normal everyday, we tend to repeat a lot of processes, sometimes without noticing. For example, if you want to cook a recipe, you might need to prepare ingredients by chopping them up. You chop and chop and chop until all the ingredients are the right size. At this point, you stop chopping. If we break down this chopping task into a series of three smaller steps, we have:\n",
    "- An **initialization**: We’re ready to cook and have a collection of ingredients we want to chop. We will start at the first ingredient.\n",
    "- A **repetition**: We’re chopping away. We are performing the action of chopping over and over on each of our ingredients, one ingredient at a time.\n",
    "- An **end condition**: We see that we have run out of ingredients to chop, so we stop.\n",

    "In programming, this process of using an initialization, repetitions, and an ending condition is called a **loop**. In a loop, we perform a process of **iteration** or *repeating tasks*.

Under the hood, the Python interpreter actually converts an iterable to an iterator. An **iterator** is a special object that gives values in succession. A major difference between a sequence and an iterator is that you cannot index an iterator. This seems like a trivial difference, but iterators make for more efficient computing than directly using a sequence with indexing.\n",

    "Most anything that requires a loop can be done with either a `for` loop or a `while` loop, but there’s a general rule of thumb for which type of loop to use. If you know how many times you have to do something (or if your program knows), use a `for` loop. If you don’t know how many times the loop needs to run until you run it, use a `while` loop. For example, when we want to do something with each character in a string or each entry in a list, the program knows how long the sequence is and a `for` loop is more appropriate. In the previous examples in this lesson, we don’t know how long it will be before we hit the start codon; it depends on the sequence you put into the program.
