    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a programming language. Like other languages, it gives us a way to communicate ideas. In the case of a programming language, these ideas are “commands” that people use to communicate specifically with a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We convey our commands to the computer by writing them in a text file using a programming language (**.py** extension). These files are called *programs* or *scripts*. Running a program means telling a computer to read the file, translate it to the set of operations that it understands, and perform those actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreted Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an *interpreted language*, which means that each line of code you write is translated, or *interpreted*, into a set of instructions that your machine can understand by the Python interpreter. This stands in contrast to compiled languages. For these languages (Fortran, C, C++, etc.), your entire code is translated into machine language before you ever run it. When you execute your program, it is already in machine language.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, whenever you want to actually run your Python code, you give it to the Python interpreter first.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to launch the Python interpreter. One way is to type into a command terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "`python`\n",
    "\n",
    "This launches the basic Python interpreter (if you installed Python 3, this is what you'll do to use it). We won't really this in the bootcamp, but instead JupyterLite via browser or JupyterLab's console.\n",

The original `Hello world.` was likely written by *Brian Kernighan*, one of the inventors of Unix, and the author of the classic and authoritative book on the C programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll first write and run this little program using a JupyterLab console or JupyterLite in browser. After launching JupyterLab, you probably already have the Launcher in your JupyterLab window. If not, you can expand the Files tab at the left of your JupyterLab window (if it is not already expanded) by clicking on that tab, or alternatively hit `ctrl+b` (or `cmd+b` on MacOS). At the top of the Files tab is a `+` sign, which gives you a Jupyter Launcher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once in the Jupyter Launcher, click the Python 3 icon under Console. This will launch a console, which has a large white space above a prompt that reads `In []:`. This is called a *code block* or a *cell* in JupyterLabs. You can enter Python code into this block, and it will be executed.\n",

This data can be a number, a string, a Boolean, a list or some other data type (there's lots of data types, which we'll review later). Every variable needs a name assigned to it to keep track ot it. This name can consist of letters, numbers, and the underscore character `_`. The equal sign `=` is used to assign a value to a variable. After the initial assignment is made, the value of a variable can be updated to new values as needed.\n",
